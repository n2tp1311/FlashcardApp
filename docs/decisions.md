# Decision Log

## 2026-07-12 — Flashcard swipe: translate `#fc-scene`, not `#fc-card`

The swipe drag transform (`translateX + rotate`) is applied to `#fc-scene` (the wrapper) rather than `#fc-card` (which carries `transform-style: preserve-3d` and the flip `rotateY(180deg)`). Applying translateX directly to `.fc-card` would compose with the flip transform, requiring separate tracking of the current flip state to avoid clobbering `rotateY`. By moving the parent scene instead, the 3D flip mechanism inside the card is untouched regardless of drag position. Alternative: keep both transforms on `.fc-card` using a matrix composition — rejected for complexity and the risk of flip-state drift on snap-back.

## 2026-07-12 — Swipe hints are DOM nodes injected into `#fc-scene`, not pseudo-elements

`✓ Biết rồi` and `✗ Học lại` label nodes are appended to `#fc-scene` at init time (not created per-swipe). They are always in the DOM with `opacity: 0` and `pointer-events: none`. This avoids repeated DOM creation/removal during gesture and keeps `opacity` directly settable from JS (pseudo-elements cannot be animated from JS without CSS custom properties). Alternative: CSS `::before`/`::after` on `.fc-scene` with a `--hint-opacity` var — rejected because two separate custom properties (one per side) plus a `data-dragging-dir` attribute still requires JS involvement; DOM nodes are simpler and no less performant.

## 2026-07-07 — Inline nav buttons use CSS media query + `.hidden` class layering

Dashboard and Analytics in the home header use two overlapping hide mechanisms: the `hidden` class (removed after login via `initUserNav()`) and a `@media (min-width:680px)` CSS rule that switches `.nav-inline-btn` from `display:none` to `display:inline-flex`. This means the buttons start hidden (no flash of content before login), and the responsive behavior is pure CSS with no JS resize listener. On narrow screens the same buttons in the ⋮ dropdown (`.dash-analytics-dropdown`) are suppressed by `display:none !important` from the same media query, so the items move between inline and dropdown without JS. Alternative: toggle classes in a JS `resize` handler — rejected because CSS media queries are simpler, instant, and avoid layout-query overhead.

## 2026-07-07 — Bulk cards: knownMap derived from returned cards instead of separate getKnownMap calls

`getKnownMap(lessonId)` hit `GET /api/lessons/:lessonId/states` which returns only `{card_id: known}` — the new `POST /api/cards/by-lessons` endpoint joins `card_states` and includes `known` in each card row directly. The client derives `knownMap` by iterating the returned cards (`c.known === 1`). This eliminates all N `getKnownMap` calls with no additional server-side cost. Alternative: keep a separate bulk-states endpoint and call it in parallel with bulk-cards — rejected because it added a second request with no benefit since both queries hit the same `card_states` table and the JOIN is the same cost.

## 2026-07-07 — Correlated subquery for last_studied_at replaced with GROUP BY aggregate JOIN

The original `GET /api/lessons/:lessonId/cards` used `(SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM attempts WHERE card_id = cards.id AND user_id = ?) AS last_studied_at` — a correlated subquery that runs once per card. With 100 cards and 3000 attempts, this triggered 100 separate scans of the attempts table. Replaced with `LEFT JOIN (SELECT card_id, MAX(created_at) AS last_studied_at FROM attempts WHERE user_id = ? GROUP BY card_id) la ON la.card_id = cards.id` — a single aggregate pass over attempts, with the result hash-joined once to all cards. The `idx_attempts_cu_created` composite index makes this aggregate nearly free. Applied to both the single-lesson endpoint and the new bulk endpoint.



## 2026-07-03 — Class sort: normalizeLevel helper extracted to prevent POST/PUT divergence

Both POST and PUT `/api/classes` need to coerce the level field (undefined → fallback, null → null, number → Number(val), NaN-string → fallback). The expression was extracted into `normalizeLevel(val, fallback)` in `classes.js` so that future validation changes (e.g., range clamp 1–999, isNaN rejection) are applied in one place. Alternative: inline the expression twice with comments — rejected because it would silently diverge if one site were updated and the other missed.

## 2026-07-03 — Class level: null sorts last (Infinity), not first

Classes with `level=null` are assigned `Infinity` in `sortClasses()` when sorting by level, causing them to sort after all leveled classes, with ties broken by `created_at`. Alternative: sort unlevel'd classes first — rejected because users set levels to promote courses to the top of their list; unlevel'd classes are implicitly "not yet sequenced."

## 2026-07-03 — Preferences localStorage cache updated on save (not just on fetch)

The `btn-save-preferences` handler now writes the new value back to `localStorage` immediately after updating state, before the PUT fetch completes. This ensures that if the user logs out and back in quickly, `loadUserPreferences()` reads the correct cached value synchronously rather than the stale pre-save value. Without this, the stale cache would be applied on the next login until the async fetch resolved.

## 2026-07-02 — Account preferences: localStorage cache to close post-login timing race

`loadUserPreferences()` fires an async fetch on every login/init. `openSetup()` reads `state.tfExpansionPctDefault` synchronously. If the user navigates to the study setup before the fetch resolves (one RTT after login), they see the hardcoded default (20%) instead of their saved value. Fixed by caching the server response in `localStorage` under `fc-preferences` and applying it synchronously at page load before `restoreLastScreen()` runs. The cache is cleared on logout to prevent cross-user bleed. Alternative: make `openSetup` async and await a preferences promise — rejected because it would require refactoring the entire navigation stack.

## 2026-07-02 — Account preferences: PUT uses read-modify-write merge, not full replace

`PUT /api/auth/preferences` reads the current `preferences` JSON column, merges the incoming object over it with `Object.assign`, then writes back. This ensures future preference keys added by new code are not silently deleted when an older client (or a client that only knows about one key) saves. Alternative: send the full preferences object from the client on every save — rejected because the client only knows about the keys it renders in the modal; it cannot preserve server-side keys it is unaware of.

## 2026-07-02 — Recall mode removed

Recall mode (free-recall textarea + three-grade self-assessment) was removed from UI and JS. The DB `source='recall'` value in the `attempts` CHECK constraint was already removed in a prior migration; historical records are preserved. Decision: recall added friction (typing + self-grading) that interrupted study flow and is superseded by MCQ→T/F expansion, which provides a comparable retrieval-practice effect with lower friction.

## 2026-06-28 — MCQ → T/F expansion: virtual cards record SRS against source card ID

When a MCQ card is expanded to T/F sub-questions, the original MCQ card is removed from the deck. To prevent MCQ cards from being permanently frozen at SRS step 0 for users who always study with T/F expansion, each virtual T/F card stores `_sourceCardId` (the original MCQ card's DB id). `answerQuiz` records the attempt using `card._sourceCardId` instead of `card.id`, so the real card's `srs_due_at` and difficulty level continue to advance. Multiple attempts are recorded per expansion (one per T/F sub-question), which is acceptable — the SRS step only advances on the last attempt in the batch. Alternative considered: record one aggregate attempt after all sub-questions for the same source are answered — rejected for complexity.

## 2026-06-28 — True/False: correct stored as lowercase string "true"/"false", displayed as title-case

The T/F answer is stored in the DB as `"true"` or `"false"` (lowercase string) to match the bulk import format (user types `| true`) and the HTML `data-value` attributes. The display layer (`answerQuiz`, `revealRecall`, `renderFlashcard`, `buildQuizOptions`) converts to title-case "True"/"False" at render time. Alternative: store as boolean — rejected because SQLite JSON stores booleans as 0/1, requiring casts in every reader, and the rest of the codebase stores card data as typed strings (MCQ `correct` is a plain string). The conversion is in one place per study mode so maintaining consistency is straightforward.

## 2026-06-27 — Multi-class quiz: home-screen select mode rather than a new screen

The multi-class study flow reuses the same select-mode pattern already used on the class screen (☑ Select button → checkboxes injected in-place → select bar with count and Study button). No intermediate lesson-picker screen was added: selecting classes goes straight to the existing `openSetup()` with all lessons from those classes combined. The existing `setStudyLessonLabel()` pill already labels each card by lesson when `studyScope.lessons.length > 1`, so cross-class sessions are already disambiguated. `returnScreen: "home"` sends the user back to the home screen after the session, which was already handled in the existing return-from-study flow. The `A` key conflict (Analytics vs Select All) is resolved by checking `state.homeSelectMode` first so Select All takes priority in select mode.

## 2026-06-25 — Analytics heatmap: UTC date keys on client match server's SQLite date('unixepoch')

The heatmap generates 90 day-cells on the client and matches them against server-supplied dates from `date(created_at,'unixepoch')` (UTC). Using local-midnight `new Date(y,m,d).toISOString().slice(0,10)` produces the wrong (previous) UTC date for users in UTC+ timezones because `toISOString()` converts local midnight to UTC before formatting. Fixed by using UTC date arithmetic: `new Date(Date.UTC(y,m,d-i))` then `.toISOString().slice(0,10)`, which correctly generates the UTC date the server would return for any given day. Similarly, `getUTCMonth()` and `getUTCDay()` are used for month label and weekday alignment rather than their local-time counterparts.

## 2026-06-25 — Analytics weekly trend uses rolling 7-day buckets, not calendar weeks

The weekly trend chart groups attempts by `(now - created_at) / 604800` integer division — this is a rolling 7-day window anchored to the current second, not Monday–Sunday calendar weeks. The label "This week" therefore means "the past 7 days" rather than the current Mon–Sun week. This was chosen because the server already has Unix timestamps and the formula is simple; calendar-week alignment would require knowing the user's day-of-week locale and aligning to week start. A future improvement could align to ISO weeks, but rolling windows are good enough for a trend chart.

## 2026-06-25 — Audio pronunciation: pointer-events fix + Safari setTimeout workaround

The 3D flip card uses `backface-visibility: hidden` to hide the back face visually, but browsers are not required to block pointer events on hidden backfaces. The back `🔊` button was therefore clickable even when the front was showing. Fixed by adding `.fc-back { pointer-events: none }` and re-enabling only after flip via `.fc-card.flipped .fc-back { pointer-events: auto }`. A separate Safari bug: calling `speechSynthesis.cancel()` then `speak()` synchronously can silently drop the utterance. Fixed by wrapping `speak()` in `setTimeout(fn, 50)`. The 50ms delay is imperceptible to users but gives the browser time to complete the cancel before starting the new utterance.

## 2026-06-27 — TTS voice selection: prefer Google/Enhanced voices, synchronous Safari init

`_pickVoice()` ranks voices: Google en-US → Enhanced/Premium/Neural en-US → any en-US → any English. Safari never fires `voiceschanged`, so the voice is also picked synchronously at script load (when `getVoices()` returns immediately on Safari). The `voiceschanged` listener is guarded with `typeof addEventListener === "function"` to avoid crashing on old Android WebViews that expose `speechSynthesis` without the full `EventTarget` interface. `rate = 0.9` gives slightly more natural cadence than the default 1.0 without noticeably slowing speech.

## 2026-06-27 — Flashcard mobile: -webkit-backface-visibility for Safari face bleed-through

On Safari/iOS, `backface-visibility: hidden` alone sometimes fails to hide the non-facing side of a 3D-transformed card, causing both front and back audio buttons to appear when flipped. Adding `-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden` alongside the unprefixed property forces Safari to apply the correct backface culling.

## 2026-06-26 — Keyboard list navigation: DOM focus (tabIndex=-1) over state index

Arrow-key navigation for class cards and lesson items uses `tabIndex=-1` + `element.focus()` (DOM-native focus management) rather than tracking a `state.focusedIndex` integer. The DOM-native approach is simpler: `moveFocus()` reads `document.activeElement`, computes the next index with `Array.indexOf`, and calls `.focus()`. No state to sync, no stale-index bugs after re-renders. Trade-off: if `renderLessons()` is called while the user is mid-navigation (e.g., after toggling select mode via `setSelectMode`), focus resets to `<body>` because `innerHTML` is wiped. Acceptable for the current UX: `setSelectMode` in-place patches the DOM without a full re-render, so the common keyboard flow (navigate → select → study) doesn't lose focus.

## 2026-06-25 — Keyboard shortcuts: unified handler + Escape-closes-any-modal

Three scattered `keydown` listeners (flashcard, quiz, recall) were replaced with a single consolidated handler at the end of `app.js`. The unified handler dispatches by `getActiveScreen()` (reads the DOM `.screen.active` element — the DOM is the sole source of truth since `showScreen()` never stores the ID in `state`). `isInputFocused()` blocks shortcuts when focus is in INPUT/TEXTAREA/SELECT. `?` and `Escape` are handled before the input-focus guard so they work globally. Escape priority: keymap modal > overlay modal (via `closeAllModals()`) > share modal > prompt-guide modal > per-screen navigation. This ensures Escape always does "the most local" thing rather than accidentally navigating away while a modal is open.

## 2026-06-26 — Image upload: two-step save (upload-then-create)

Image cards use a two-step flow: upload the image first (`POST /api/upload` → returns `{url}`), then save the card with the URL in `data.imageUrl`. The alternative — multipart form submission combining image + JSON in one request — was rejected because it would require parsing `data` fields out of a multipart body alongside the file, mixing form-data encoding with JSON. The two-step approach keeps card creation as a clean JSON POST that matches all other card formats, and the upload endpoint remains a focused single-purpose route. Trade-off: an upload can succeed but the subsequent card creation can fail, leaving an orphaned file. Accepted as low-risk for a single-user or small-team context.

## 2026-06-26 — Upload race condition fix: sequence counter

`handleImageFile()` sets a module-level `uploadSeq` counter and captures `mySeq = ++uploadSeq` at call time. The fetch `.then()` callback only writes to `stagedImageUrl` if `uploadSeq === mySeq` (i.e., no newer upload started). This is simpler than `AbortController` (which would require cancelling in-flight requests) and sufficient because only the last-picked image should be staged — stale completions are simply ignored.

## 2026-06-26 — Schema migrations: `schema_migrations` table for idempotency

The previous table-copy migration pattern (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS _v2 → INSERT OR IGNORE → DROP old → RENAME`) re-ran every server startup because the `_v2` table was renamed away each time. Added a `schema_migrations` table with `name TEXT PRIMARY KEY`; each migration inserts its name before the destructive DROP so subsequent startups skip it. The insert happens before DROP so a crash between insert and DROP leaves the migration marked as done but the old table intact — safe because the old table still has the correct data and the migration's purpose (removing a CHECK constraint) is a no-op if the constraint is already gone in practice.

## 2026-06-18 — SQLite via node-sqlite3-wasm
Use WASM-based SQLite (no native build) for Railway compatibility. Downside: async init. Lock file `flashcards.db.lock` removed on startup to survive container restarts.

## 2026-06-23 — Sessions migrated from MemoryStore to SQLiteSessionStore
MemoryStore is cleared on every Railway container restart, forcing re-login on mobile rotation (which triggers a reload). Replaced with a custom `SQLiteSessionStore` (server/sessionStore.js) that writes to the existing SQLite DB using a `sessions` table. The store implements only `get/set/destroy/touch` — the minimum express-session contract. A 24-hour `setInterval` sweeps expired rows. No external dependency needed since node-sqlite3-wasm is already bundled.

## 2026-06-23 — Screen state persisted via localStorage key fc-last-screen
The SPA had no URL routing — page refresh always landed on home. Added `saveScreenState()` called at navigation points (openClass, openLesson, back buttons) and `restoreLastScreen()` called on init/login/register. Only home/class/lesson are persisted; transient screens (study, quiz, flashcard) are not. Stale entries for deleted entities fall back to home via the `.catch()` path. The key is cleared on logout and on fresh registration to prevent cross-user state bleed.

## 2026-06-18 — Sessions via express-session + MemoryStore (superseded 2026-06-23)
Simple session approach for single-instance Railway deployment. Replaced by SQLiteSessionStore.

## 2026-06-18 — Google OAuth without passport
Implemented raw OAuth2 code-exchange to avoid passport setup complexity. fetch() to Google token and userinfo endpoints directly.

## 2026-06-19 — Per-card SRS step-based intervals (replaces session-level)
Replaced the session-level score-based scheduler with per-card spaced repetition. Each card has its own `srs_step` (0–6) and `srs_due_at` (unix seconds) stored in `card_states`. Correct answer advances the step; wrong resets to 0. Steps map to intervals: 10min → 1h → 4h → 1d → 3d → 7d → 21d. This means a card the user just learned will resurface in 10 minutes, then again in an hour — much faster feedback than the old session-level 4h minimum. Cards are "due" when `srs_due_at <= now`. Due counts surface on class cards, lesson list, and dashboard (grouped by class). Decision: step-based rather than SM-2/FSRS to keep the implementation simple while delivering the core SRS benefit; FSRS remains a future upgrade path.

## 2026-06-18 — Spaced repetition intervals (superseded)
Simple fixed intervals based on quiz score: ≥90% → 7d, ≥70% → 3d, ≥50% → 1d, <50% → 4h. Stored in quiz_sessions table. Replaced 2026-06-19 by per-card step-based intervals.

## 2026-06-18 — Progressive difficulty via weighted shuffle
Hard cards (blended error ≥0.6) appear 3× in weighted pool, medium (0.3–0.6) 2×, easy/new 1×. Deduplication after shuffle preserves front-loading effect.

## 2026-06-18 — Interleaved study as default for multi-lesson sessions
When 2+ lessons are selected, cards from all lessons are pooled and shuffled together (interleaved) by default rather than completing each lesson in sequence (blocked). Backed by learning science: a 2024 *Learning and Instruction* study confirmed interleaved practice produces more durable retention than blocked practice. Users can switch to Blocked via a "Card Order" pill on the setup screen. The pill is hidden for single-lesson sessions where the distinction is moot.

## 2026-06-18 — Confidence-Based Repetition (CBR) deferred
CBR (1–5 post-answer confidence rating modulates next review interval) was researched and found to have solid evidence for improving long-term recall. Decision: deferred. The per-card rating UI felt too intensive in user testing — it interrupts the study flow on every card. Will revisit if users request finer-grained spaced repetition control.

## 2026-06-18 — FSRS algorithm skipped for now
FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) achieves 20–30% fewer reviews than SM-2 for the same 90% retention target. An open-source JS library is available. Decision: skipped for now. The existing fixed-interval scheduler (score-based: ≥90% → 7d, ≥70% → 3d, etc.) is good enough for the current user base. FSRS can be added as a future enhancement without changing the quiz flow — only the interval-calculation step changes.

## 2026-06-23 — Card checkbox change event + item click guard for select mode
In card select mode, a guard `if (e.target.tagName === "INPUT") return` on the item's click listener prevents double-toggling when the user clicks the checkbox (the click would bubble to the item, firing toggleCardSelection twice). However, this alone breaks direct checkbox clicks — the native checkbox state changes but `state.selectedCardIds` doesn't. Fixed by also attaching a `change` event on each card's checkbox that calls `toggleCardSelection`. Result: clicking the item body fires one toggle (via item click); clicking the checkbox fires one toggle (via change); the bubble from checkbox click is suppressed by the guard.

## 2026-06-18 — Modal architecture fix: scope closeAllModals to overlay container
`closeAllModals()` was calling `document.querySelectorAll(".modal")`, which also matched inner divs inside `#modal-share` and `#modal-prompt-guide` (those overlays contain child elements that also carry the `.modal` class). This caused closing any modal to blank-screen those overlays. Fixed by scoping the selector to `"#modal-overlay .modal"` so only the primary overlay's modal content is targeted. Also added an explicit `.modal` classList `.remove("hidden")` guard inside `openShareModal()` and the prompt-guide opener as a defensive reset against stale state.

## 2026-06-18 — Dev reset token hidden in production
`POST /api/auth/forgot-password` was returning `_devResetUrl` in the JSON response unconditionally, allowing anyone to grab a password-reset token without SMTP access. Fixed: the field is now only included when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`. In production without SMTP configured, the endpoint returns `{ok:true}` with no token exposed, and the reset email is silently dropped (no SMTP = no email sent, user experience unchanged).

## 2026-06-19 — Variable MCQ choices: dynamic rows over static 5 fields
MCQ cards now support 1–4 distractors (2–5 total choices) instead of a fixed 3. Two UI approaches were considered: (A) 5 static input fields with the first required and others optional, (B) dynamic rows with add/remove buttons starting from 1. Chose B: MCQ authoring is deliberate, not a fast-input flow, so clean UX (only the fields you need) outweighs the small amount of extra JS. Server validates `distractors.length` is 1–4 on both single and bulk card endpoints. `clearDistractorList()` caps at 4 rows on load to guard against corrupt DB data.

## 2026-07-11 — Search uses command-palette pattern (standalone overlay) over filter-in-place

Two industry patterns were considered for global search: (A) filter-in-place — search bar in the main nav that filters the current list in real time; (B) command palette — modal overlay opened by Ctrl/Cmd+K that searches all content types simultaneously. Chose B because (A) only works on the currently visible screen and can't reach across classes/lessons/cards in one step; the command palette pattern (Linear, Notion, VS Code) is better suited for navigating a hierarchical content tree without knowing exactly where something lives. The standalone modal also avoids adding persistent nav space for a feature most users won't use every interaction.

## 2026-07-11 — Card text extracted server-side via CASE/json_extract rather than full-scan in client

The search endpoint needed to search card text across four formats (term-def, mcq, true-false, image-def), each storing text in a different JSON field. Options: (A) fetch all card JSON rows and parse in JS; (B) use a stored/generated column; (C) use a CASE expression in the WHERE/SELECT with `json_extract`. Chose C: it runs a single SQL pass with no extra storage, no migration, and no application-layer JSON parsing. The CASE expression is duplicated between the SELECT alias and the WHERE COALESCE — a known SQLite limitation (no reference to SELECT aliases in WHERE), but SQLite query planning computes it efficiently.

## 2026-06-18 — Multi-agent development workflow adopted
Established a three-role agent loop: Planner (Plan subagent) produces step-by-step implementation specs; Executor (main Claude session) implements them; Reviewer (general-purpose subagent) audits the diff for correctness and security. A fourth Research agent (general-purpose with WebSearch) is spun up on-demand for evidence gathering. This separation prevents context contamination between planning and implementation and gives each role a clean starting point.
